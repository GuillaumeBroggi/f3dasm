Machine learning
================

To use the machine learning in the data-driven process, 
we encourage the user to :ref:`export the ExperimentData object <experimentdata-store-other>` to your datatype of choice, and after your analysis, :ref:`import the results <experimentdata-own>` back into an ExperimentData object.
