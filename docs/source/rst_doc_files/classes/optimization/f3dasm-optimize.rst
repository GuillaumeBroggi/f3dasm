:code:`f3dasm-optimize`
=======================


The :mod:`f3dasm.datageneration` module is designed to be easily extended by third-party libraries.
In order to not bloat the main :mod:`f3dasm` package, these extensions are provided as separate package: `f3dasm_optimize <https://github.com/bessagroup/f3dasm_optimize>`_.

More ports to optimization algorithms are available in the `f3dasm_optimize <https://github.com/bessagroup/f3dasm_optimize>`_ package, which can be installed via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install f3dasm_optimize

More information about this extension can be found in the `f3dasm_optimize documentation page <https://bessagroup.github.io/f3dasm_optimize/>`_
