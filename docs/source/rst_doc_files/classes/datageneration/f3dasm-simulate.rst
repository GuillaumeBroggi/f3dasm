=======================

Extend the Simulation capabilities
------------------------------------

The :mod:`f3dasm.datageneration` module is designed to be easily extended by third-party libraries.
In order to not bloat the main :mod:`f3dasm` package, these extensions are provided as separate package: `f3dasm_simulate <https://github.com/bessagroup/f3dasm_simulate>`_.

More ports to simulation software are available in the `f3dasm_simulate <https://github.com/bessagroup/f3dasm_simulate>`_ package, which can be installed via pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install f3dasm_simulate

More information about this extension can be found in the `f3dasm_simulate documentation page <https://bessagroup.github.io/f3dasm_simulate/>`_
